    Run on Save - VSCode Extension
</h1>

Configure shell commands and related file patterns, commands will be executed when matched files were saved.


## Features

You can specify status bar messages which will show before and after commands executing, such that they will tell you what's happening and not distrub you much:

If you prefer running commands in vscode terminal, which keeps message colors and give more feedback details, change the `runIn` option to `terminal`.

If you need to run VS Code's commands change `runIn` option to `vscode`


## Configuration

| Name                             | Description
| ---                              | ---
| `runOnSave.statusMessageTimeout` | Specify the default timeout milliseconds after which the status bar message will hide, default value is `3000`, means 3 seconds.
| `runOnSave.ignoreFilesBy`        | Specifies it to ignore files that list in `.gitignore` or `.npmignore`. default value is empty list.
| `runOnSave.shell`                | Specify in which shell the commands are executed, defaults to the default vscode shell.
| `runOnSave.defaultRunIn`         | Specify default `commands[].runIn` for all the commands, defaults to `backend` if not specified.
| `runOnSave.onlyRunOnManualSave`  | Whether to only run commands when a file is manually saved, defaults to `false`.
| `runOnSave.commands`             | Specify the array of commands to execute and related info, its child options as below.

### Command Options

Note, `languages`, `match`, `globMatch` work like filter, if specifies more than one, command must match all then can run. So normally specifying one of them would be enough.

| Name                              | Description
| ---                               | ---
| `commands[].languages`            | Specify an array of language ids to filter commands, when language matches command will run.
| `commands[].match`                | Specify RegExp source string, files which's full file system path (Notice the slash separator difference on platforms) match will be included. E.g.: `\\.scss$` can used to match scss files.
| `commands[].notMatch`             | Specify RegExp source string, files which's path match will be excluded even they were included by `match` or `globMatch`. E.g.: `[\\\\\\/]_[\\w-]+\\.scss$` can be used to exclude scss library files.
| `commands[].globMatch`            | Specify a glob expression, to match the whole file path or the relative path relative to current workspace directory. the matched files will be included. E.g.: `**/*.scss` will match all scss files, `*.scss` will match all scss files located in current workspace directory.
| `commands[].globMatchOptions`     | Specify glob match options for  `globMatch` expression above, see [Minimatch Options](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch?tab=readme-ov-file#options). |
| `commands[].command`              | Specify the shell command to execute. You may include variable substitution like what to do in [VSCode Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_variable-substitution).
| `commands[].commandBeforeSaving`  | Same as `commands`, but runs it before saving action happens, and document is not saved yet.
| `commands[].args`                 | Specify the command parameters, can be a string, array of string, or an object.
| `commands[].forcePathSeparator`   | Force path separator in variable substitution to be `/`, `\\`, default is not specified.
| `commands[].async`                | All the commands with `async: false` will run in a sequence, means run next after previous completed. Default value is `true`. |
| `commands[].runningStatusMessage` | Specify the status bar message when the shell command begin to run, supports variable substitution too. Only works when `runIn=backend`.
| `commands[].finishStatusMessage`  | Specify the status bar message after the shell command finished executing, also supports variable substitution. Only works when `runIn=backend`.
| `commands[].statusMessageTimeout` | Specify the timeout milliseconds of current message, after which the status bar message will hide, default value is `3000`, means 3 seconds.
| `commands[].terminalHideTimeout`  | Specify the timeout in milliseconds after which the terminal for running current command will hide. Only works when `runIn=terminal`. If default value is `-1`, set it as a value `>=0` can make it work.
| `commands[].workingDirectoryAsCWD`| Specify the vscode working directory as shell CWD (Current Working Directory). Only works when `runIn=backend`.
| `commands[].clearOutput`          | Clear the output channel before running current command. Default value is `false`.
| `commands[].doNotDisturb`         | By default, output tab would get focus after receiving non-zero exit codes. Set this option to `true` can prevent it. Works when `runIn=backend` or `terminal`.
| `commands[].runIn`                | See list below. Default value is specified by `runOnSave.defaultRunIn`, or `vscode`.
 - `backend`: Run command silently and show messages in output channel, you can specify runningStatusMessage and finishStatusMessage to give you a little feedback. Choose this when you don't want to be disturbed.
 - `terminal`: Run command in vscode terminal, which keeps message colors. Choose this when you want to get feedback details.
 - `vscode`: Run vscode's command. Choose this if you want to execute vscode's own command or a command of a particular extension.


### Sample Configuration

```js
{
    "runOnSave.statusMessageTimeout": 3000,
    "runOnSave.commands": [
        {
            // Match scss files except names start with `_`.
            "match": ".*\\.scss$",
            "notMatch": "[\\\\\\/]_[^\\\\\\/]*\\.scss$",
            "command": "node-sass ${file} ${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.css",
            "runIn": "backend",
            "runningStatusMessage": "Compiling ${fileBasename}",
            "finishStatusMessage": "${fileBasename} compiled"
        },
        {
            // Match less files except names start with `_`.
            "globMatch": "**/[^_]*.less",
            "command": "node-sass ${file} ${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.css",
            "runIn": "terminal"
        },
        {
            // Match any python files by path.
            "match": ".*\\.py$",
            "command": "python.runLinting",
            "runIn": "vscode"
        },
        {
            // Match any python files by language id.
            "languages": ["python"],
            "command": "python.runLinting",
            "runIn": "vscode"
        }
    ]
}
```


### Variable Substitution

Can be used in `command`, `runningStatusMessage`, `finishStatusMessage`, `globMatch`.

Note that if `forcePathSeparator` specified, separators in these variables will be replaced.

| Variable                     | Description
| ---                          | ---

| `${file}`                    | the path of current opened file.
| `${fileBasename}`            | the basename part of current opened file.
| `${fileBasenameNoExtension}` | the basename part without extension of current opened file.
| `${fileExtname}`             | the extension part of current opened file.
| `${fileRelative}`            | the shorter relative file path part from current vscode working directory.
| `${fileDirname}`             | the dirname path part of current opened file.

| `${config:vsConfigName}`     | reference vscode configuration name `vsConfigName`.
| `${command:vsCommandName}`   | execute vscode command `vsCommandName`, and reference returned result.


To better distinguish file path associated variables, assume you have opened a workspace located at `/Users/UserName/ProjectName`, and you are editing `folderName/subFolderName/fileName.css` inside of it, then:

| Variable                     | Value
| ---                          | ---
| `${workspaceFolder}`         | `/Users/UserName/ProjectName`
| `${workspaceFolderBasename}` | `ProjectName`
| `${file}`                    | `/Users/UserName/ProjectName/folderName/subFolderName/fileName.css`
| `${fileBasename}`            | `fileName.css`
| `${fileBasenameNoExtension}` | `fileName`
| `${fileExtname}`             | `css`
| `${fileRelative}`            | `folderName/subFolderName/fileName.css`
| `${fileDirname}`             | `/Users/UserName/ProjectName/folderName/subFolderName`
| `${fileDirnameBasename}`     | `subFolderName`
| `${fileDirnameRelative}`     | `folderName/subFolderName`
